A small project for the game Minecraft where you can add other players as friends.

The Friendships plugin is written in Java (Java 17) with Maven as the build tool. It tries to obey the S.O.L.I.D. principles while being as simplistic as possible.
The project could potentially be coupled up to Jenkins.
Git is being used for version control.
