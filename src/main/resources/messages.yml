#
# INTRODUCTION:
# This file contains all the messages that are used in the plugin. You can change the messages to your liking.
# The messages are used in the plugin to give feedback to the player when they execute a command or when the plugin is enabled or disabled.
#
# CHANGE MESSAGES:
# To easily find and modify the messages, you can do the following:
# 1. Open the file in your IDE or Text Editor
# 2. Press CTRL + F or CMD + F
# 3. Type in the message you want to change - See section "MESSAGE STRUCTURE" for more information
# 4. Change the message to your liking
# 5. Save the file
# 6. Reload the plugin using the "/friends reload messages" command, or by restarting the server
#
# MESSAGE STRUCTURE:
# The messages are structured in a key-value format. The key is the name of the message, and the value is the message itself.
# There is a pretty clear structure to follow here, as it is separated into sections:
# 1. Anything overall plugin related is prefixed with "plugin." - You're probably never going to touch this.
# 2. Anything database related is prefixed with "database." - You're probably never going to touch this.
# 3. Anything command related is prefixed with "command."
#    - EXAMPLE: "command.reload.config.success":
#      Here, the main key is "command" as you are targeting commands, then the command itself is "reload".
#      Which, in game, would be "/friends reload" - and then the sub key is "config" which is the subcommand of "reload".
#      You will usually just search for "command.reload" and then you will receive everything related to the command "/friends reload".
#
# SUPPORTED FORMATTING:
# The plugin supports the Adventure library for text formatting - Adventure is a library for server-controllable user interfaces and text components.
# You can read more about the formatting here, it is pretty easy to get a hang of: https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html
#
# TIPS:
# To easily change the color codes, do the following:
# 1. Open the file in your IDE or Text Editor
# 2. Press CTRL + F or CMD + F
# 3. Find out how to enable search and replace in your IDE or Text Editor
# 4. Type in the color code you want to change - EXAMPLE: "#2FA7D6"
# 5. Change the color code to your liking - EXAMPLE: "<#AF6EF0>" to "<#FF0000>
# 5.1 Remember to change the end tag as well - EXAMPLE: "</#AF6EF0>" to "</#FF0000>"
# 6. Save the file
# 7. Reload the plugin using the "/friends reload messages" command, or by restarting the server
#
# The default color codes are:
# - #2FA7D6: A light blue color - Used for titles and headers
# - #AF6EF0: A light purple color - Used for commands and subcommands
# - #8E8E8E: A light grey color - Used for descriptions and explanations
# - #4DAD5B: A light green color - Used for success messages
# - #E3340D: A light red color - Used for error messages
# - #CC0000: A dark red color - Used for important messages
